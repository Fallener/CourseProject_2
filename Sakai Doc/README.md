#How to use start a demo Sakai.

1. Download Demo
	URL: <http://source.sakaiproject.org/release/2.9.3/artifacts/sakai-demo-2.9.3.zip>
	
2. Prepare at least **1G** of memory.

	Sakai will eat up most of them. And you would need more to run your eclipse of other IDE.
	
3. Unpack downloaded file.

4. Start

	Go into the unpacked directory, double click file `start-sakai.bat`. It will take around 1mins(or even longer) to start Sakai. **Note:** Do not
	close the window opened by `start-sakai.bat`.
	
5. Test

	Open <http://localhost:8080/portal> to see your demo. Default user name:
	admin, password: admin.
	
6. Stop

	Go into the unpacked directory, double click file `stop-sakai.bat`. It will take sometime for it to close completely.
